# mysql_handler

A simple mysql handler that works with mysql2 package in node.js. This handler will allow you to execute SQL queries using function executeQuery() and supports DB connection pool.

I was unable to find a relevant example or code sample for DB pooling with MYSQL on the internet therefore I ended up writing one and sharing with all others who might be looking for samples and examples.
